            <dt>What is this site?</dt>
            <dd>Bike Share Pal provides a simple interface for checking bike share station locations and their relevant bike
                and dock availability, alongside more detailed information such as average availability over time and
                photos of the stations.
            </dd>

            <dt>Where do you get the data from?</dt>
            <dd>The bike share data used on this site is gathered from <a
                    href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#84045f23-7465-0892-8889-7b6f91049b29">Bike
                Share Toronto's open data API</a> under the <a

                Government License - Toronto</a>.
            </dd>

            <dt>How often is the station data updated?</dt>
            <dd>We update our data every 5 minutes, so any listed bike and dock availability numbers are at most 5
                minutes old.
            </dd>

            <dt>Why do you need us to upload photos?</dt>
            <dd>There are currently {{ num_stations }} active stations in Toronto, so while we do try to have up-to-date photos ourselves,
            we need the help of the community to keep the photos useful and current. These photos make it easier to
            know where the stations are before-hand, making it easier to find them in an unfamiliar location.</dd>
